# dandelions
pretty little flowers with a very cool seed dispersal parachute system.

The image randomly updates every 4 hrs. The python script in this repo is what i use to udate the image. You'll need to add your own github username, personal access token, and repo info. You can probaly just find & replace all of the occurences of "dandelions" with whatever your repo is called / what you want the main image to be called.

To run this create a folder for the script, and within that folder `git clone` your repo that will hold the images. Then run the script with `python dandelions-bot.py` or whatever you call your own. This was made for .png files, so youll need to change the script a bit to use other image formats. Any images u[ploaded to the repo with the .png extension will be used.

To add the image to a token, just use Safew wallet to create an image token with the main image url.
