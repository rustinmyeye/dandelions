The image randomly updates every 4 hrs. The pyhton script in this repo, is what i use to udate the image. You'll need to add your own github username, personal access token, and repo info. you can probaly just find & replace all of the occurences of "dandelions" with whatever your repo is called / waht you want the main image to be called. 

To add the image to a token, just use Safew wallet to create an image token with the main image url.
